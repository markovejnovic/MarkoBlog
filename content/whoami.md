[Who Am I?](https://ss64.com/bash/whoami.html)

```bash
$ whoami
marko
```

I'm Marko Vejnovic, a high school student from [Bosnia &
Herzegovina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina). I'm
currently studying in [UWC Changshu China](http://www.uwcchina.org/en). 

I can't tell you who I am (I'd like to know that myself, hah)

First and foremost in my life came music. I grew up with music. Coming from a
place where music is objectively unartistic and uninspired, I was quite lucky
that my father listened to good music. From
[Tchaikovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky) to
[Rammstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rammstein), my father listened to a
variety of musical genres. He showed me what good music was - rock, the blues,
country, you name it, he showed it to me. As time would pass, I would develop
my own taste, and start exploring music myself - jazz, country, old-school
blues, metal.
