# Introduction

A few mates of mine and I got back together in UWC. We decided to play for the 
first open mic<sup>1</sup> of this year in UWC CSC. Given that three out of 
four band members enjoy metal, we decided to play metal for the open mic. This 
was a first for the school, since metal was never played on this campus. We 
decided for the first song to be a lighter one, so we decided on Maiden's hit 
[The Trooper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G5rfPISIwo).

# Practicing

Our band didn't really have a bassist, so we got a friend to play the bass - 
Shadman. Now, Shadman never played an instrument, but he seemed very interested
in learning to play, so we helped him out. Turns out playing the gallop was 
tough for him, but after a few hours of practice he got it.

# The singing

Well, we didn't really have a singer, and none of us can sing. The thing was, 
nobody really wanted to sing metal, so one of us had to do it. I already knew 
the lyrics, so I was the singer.

# The solo

Something I had to dedicate a bit more time to was the two solos of the song. 
Although they aren't considered difficult, my technical knowledge isn't really 
on par, so I had to practice quite a bit. 8 hours in, I got both solos down and
we were ready to rumble.

# The performance

The performance was alright, I'd say. The lack of monitors, proper microphones,
a microphone stand definitely didn't help, but we managed!

# Footnotes
<sup>1</sup> The open mic is a biweekly thing where everybody gets to show off 
their talents, passions, etc. in UWC CSC.
