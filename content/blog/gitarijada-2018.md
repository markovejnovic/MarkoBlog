# Introduction

After finishing up my ACT test and figuring stuff out after coming back from 
UWC Changshu, I get a ring from an old mate of mine who asks me if our old band 
would like to go to the annual guitar festival in my hometown of Banja Luka. 

Our old band consisted of three guys - David Crncevic, Aleksandar Curguz and 
myself. We used to play metal, but since both David and me were going to UWC's 
we couldn't continue playing together.

So, Aleksandar rang me up, we talked to David, and we got back together. I 
decided I didn't want to play bass for the band, but that I'd stick to rhythm 
guitar. Moreover, we got another member, Aleksandar's sister - Anastasija 
Curguz. Aleksandar decided to play the bass, while Anastasija played the drums. 
We changed our name to "Fijasko" according to a book I had on my shelves, and 
we started working together.

# Preparation

The sketchy thing was the fact that the deadline for submitting two original 
songs was three days after we got together. Aleksandar had some songs ready, 
so we decided to use what was kind of ready. We modified his songs to be a bit 
more interesting.

Aleksandar and me kind of stuck to playing harmonious riffs and rhythms that 
went well with what David and Anastasija played.

We recorded everything in Aleksandar's house, since we didn't have the 
opportunity nor the funds required to get a professional studio. Luckily, to 
our aid came the Faculty of Arts in Banja Luka, as they borrowed us their 
[Zoom H6](https://www.zoom-na.com/products/field-video-recording/field-recording/h6-handy-recorder).
My father had a directional film recording mic, so we used that as well. Since 
the H6 can record a wide range with its default microphone, we used the default 
two channels for the drums, and my father's 
[Audio Technica Shotgun Microphone](https://www.audio-technica.com/cgi-bin/product_search/wired_mics/mics_by_type.pl?product_type=Microphones%3A+Shotgun&lang=eng)
for the guitar amplifiers. Finally, we directly plugged in the bass into the 
internal mixer of the H6, and we recorded all tracks. Everything was covered 
in blankets so as to reduce the reverb to a minimum.

Finally, we recorded the vocals separately, due to a lack of gear.

We did the mixing in [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/) as I 
already knew how to use it pretty well. After a bit of track separation and 
realignment, added effects, volume tuning, etc, we got a sound we were happy 
with.

We submitted the songs, and not shortly after, got accepted into the festival.

# A nightmare

Of course, we didn't really practice any more till the concert itself. Two 
nights before the concert itself, David wakes up in the middle of the night, 
sweating profusely. He had a nightmare - the organizers called him up, and 
told him that we need to have three songs, rather than two. The next morning, 
Aleksandar calls up the organizers, and lo and behold, his nightmare was true - 
we did need to make three songs, not two.

We met up the next eve, and started creating a song. David had invented a very 
nice sounding riff, we created some "less than poetic" lyrics, and the rhythm 
was a pretty cool hard rock style rhythm. We practiced, and after 4 hours of 
work, we got our song - "Deadly Sins".

# The concert itself

When we came to the concert, we got ready, got in tune, had our tone check, and 
just messed around till our time came. We climbed up the stage, and, well, we 
played:

Overall, it was a great experience!
