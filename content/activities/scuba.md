In 2017, around March, I was quite lucky to be able to enroll in a SCUBA diving
course. I was required to remain physically calm, ie. control my breathing,
even when my body would resist me.

In a sense, I've found it stoic to be able to control one's body with nothing
but reason.

But that doesn't matter. What I've found to be even more beautiful was that
there was this whole other undiscovered world sitting literally a few feet 
under us and all it took to see it was to look in the right place.
