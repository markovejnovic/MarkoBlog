In the summer of 2016, I had the opportunity of going through basic training
for a sailplane license. Not only was this by far the best experience in my
life (being an admirer of planes since childhood), but this activity has helped
me hone many skills - remaining calm in the face of apparent danger, and
patience, being the two most important ones.

I experienced true freedom - lifting myself from the ground and seeing the
world clearly. This is the activity I loved the most, and miss the most.
