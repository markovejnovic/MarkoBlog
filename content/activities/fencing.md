In 2014, an Italian fencer by the name of _Giacomo Fanizza_ came to my hometown
to try and spread the fencing culture to a country which did not have it. He
almost single-handedly managed to raise some interest and created a fencing
club.

A dozen or so of us joined the club in the beginning, but as years went on,
people started leaving. Sadly, _Giacomo_ was forced to go back to Italy due to
financial reasons.

However, a small group of old remaining fencers _continued the tradition_ of
fencing. We trained recreationally twice a week, for a few years.

Sadly, in 2017, I had to stop fencing because I had to go to _UWC_.
