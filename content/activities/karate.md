In 2006, I was inspired by the likes of actors like _Jackie Chan_ to pick up a
martial art. My father saw a poster for a Karate club inviting new members, so I
signed up.

At such a young age, I found Karate to be a very good practice for my body as
well as a way of venting a lot of the issues I had inside and outside of school.

I grew up with Karate. It helped me develop both physically and mentally.

After many years of hard work, in 2017, I achieved the first Dan - the first
black belt.

Sadly, in 2017, like with fencing, I had to stop this sport, just because I was
going to _UWC Changshu China_.
