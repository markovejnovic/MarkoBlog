# Introduction
As an aspiring, albeit unsuccessful guitar player, I felt the need to have a wah pedal<sup>1</sup>. Of course, not having the resources to buy one forced me to build one. I wanted to achieve a Hendrix-like sound, so I decided to opt for a [Vox V847A](https://www.musiciansfriend.com/amplifiers-effects/vox-v847a-wah-wah-pedal) design.

The transistors I used were readily available _[2N5457](https://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/2N5457-D.PDF)_'s.
