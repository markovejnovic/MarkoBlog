# Introduction
At the time, I used to have very high impedance headphones (if I remember - around 40Î©), so the audio output volume I was receiving from my computer was very low. I therefore wanted to make a small amplifier for those headphones. At first, I wanted to make a very simple LM386A-based amplifier, but I stumbled upon [this](https://www.instructables.com/id/Class-A-Hybrid-Headphone-Amp/) small tube amplifier. I liked the idea of having a small tube amplifier, so I decided to make it.

# Schematic

Mr. Beau's amplifier design is given in the following picture:

Note that the design is a hybrid one, revolving around a single tube. The ECC82 is a dual triode tube, which made this design very simple.

# PCB Design

The inverted PCB design Mr. Beau provided is given:
