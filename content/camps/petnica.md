The [Petnica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petnica_Science_Center) is an
independent institution of which the main goal is the development of scientific
culture, scientific literacy and education in general. It offers week-long
courses in various fields of science.

In 2016, after an application, I was invited to the winter
mathematical-technical course of the institution. This course, I'd say, wasn't
special in any specific matter, but it did open my eyes to another way of
looking at science and engineering.

I then attended the summer and autumn courses for applied physics and
electronics which where far more fulfilling. I learned how to do proper
scientific research, how to write scientific articles and how to analyze data.
We did research on various topics, ranging from simulations to PIC programming.

Sadly, due to personal mishaps, I could not attend the next year's spring camp
completely. I was however invited to the summer course of 2017. For this summer
camp we were required to present a project on which we would do research. I
wanted to make a DIY Scanning Tunneling Microscope.

The issue was that I was going to China. Because I was going to UWC Changshu
China, I could not attend Petnica.
