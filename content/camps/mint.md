This project was a student exchange between [HHG
Kaiserslautern](https://www.hhg-kl.de/) and my old school - [The Grammar School
of Banja Luka](http://www.gimnazijabanjaluka.org/). The project was targetting
students who were interested in and excel at mathematics, ICT, science, etc.

The goal was for stduents of HHG and The Grammar School of Banja Luka to work
together to build a 3D printer, and present improvements for the printer,
including solutions for problems. The printer was successfully constructed, but
due to limited time, improvements to the printer were very limited.

Nonetheless, I think that the project was good. Besides the facts that we got to
interact with students from Germany, welcome them to our homes and even go to
Germany ourselves, I think the project was very useful in developing our
collaboration skills!
