The [Pitam Da](http://www.znanje.org/pitamDa/Pitam_da.htm) camp for young
software engineers is a camp organized in my old school, [The Grammar School of
Banja Luka](http://www.gimnazijabanjaluka.org/), for aspiring software
engineers. I joined the camp in grade 10.

The camp was about teaching us useful concepts ranging from objective-oriented
programming to threads. However, I found the course to be a tad too slow,
Windows-focused and business-centered, which, at the time, I was not interested
in.

I left the class at the end of the year, but I still find that some soft skills
I learned there were very useful, most notably a collaborative spirit.
