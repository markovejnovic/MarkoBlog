I'm usually the kind of person who would not go about doing community service.
I simply don't believe that as a teenager I can do much by organizing
activities of picking up plastic bags or whatnot, when people are going to
throw plastic bags the very next day.
I find that a better way of improving our lives is not through "community
service", but rather by educating ourselves properly and then making an actual
impact.
I'm the type of guy who will never say no if you need help with understanding a
topic, or with some homework. I think that sharing knowledge is the most
impactful way of improving the human condition. That's why my notable
"service" activities are of me trying to share knowledge.
