The electrical engineering club of The Grammar School of Banja Luka was founded
in 2016. I founded it in hopes of trying to teach and spark interest in fellow
students about electronics, and to an extent, programming.

It was somewhat successful, as there were half a handful of my ex-students who
do electronics in their free time to this day. I had a both theoretical and
practical approach.

I taught them how to make their own PCBs at home, how to solder and similar
skills, alongside with the theoretical nature of electronics. I believe that
this was quite important, as back home, many young people cannot afford buying
parts and ready-made PCBs themselves, and are therefore required to scrap
components themselves, something one of my best students did regularly.
