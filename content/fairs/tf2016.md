After not receiving any awards at the _INOST_ festival of the year, I was
invited by [The programming camp _Pitam
Da_](http://www.znanje.org/pitamDa/Pitam_da.htm) to present my oscilloscope on
the annual _Tesla Festival_ in Novi Sad. Reluctantly, I agreed.

Contrary to my prejudice, it's been an excellent experience, from hanging 
around with friends to actually presenting our own projects, we all had a 
wonderful and fun experience.

I did win a shared<sup>1</sup> first prize on the festival, among some of my 
friends.

More information about the festival is available

English.

### Footnotes
<sup>1</sup> Note the first prize was shared among a larger pool of people. If 
my memory serves me right, it was around _20_ people.
