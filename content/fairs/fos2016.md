Similarly to the previous previous _Festival of Science_, I wanted to show
science in a field that young children enjoy. So a friend of mine, David
Crncevic, and myself decided to marry science and music.

Each of us made our own
[FuzzFace](https://www.jimdunlop.com/product/jdf2-7-10137-00650-8.do) clones and
we tried to show how exactly music is innately connected to science.

I'd say we succeeded - kids enjoyed our playing, as well as showed interest in
science.

You can read a bit more on the festival, in general, [from our local 
newspaper](https://banjaluka.net/u-domu-omladine-otvoren-festival-nauke/).
