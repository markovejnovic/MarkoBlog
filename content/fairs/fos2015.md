The _Festival of Science_ is a fair which tries to promote science with younger
people. I decided to try promoting mathematics with middle-school students by
introducing mathematics in the popular field of computers.

I decided that showing them basic
[TTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor%E2%80%93transistor_logic)
circuits, and how from these we can make basic calculators.

I then showed them how boolean logic describes these TTL circuits beautifully.

I'd say that the middle school students enjoyed this, because they like
computers so I think it was good that I introduced mathematics (which is
generally not popular) into a very popular field.
