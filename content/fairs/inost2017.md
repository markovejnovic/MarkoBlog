On this year's _INOST_ fair, I decided to present what I was working on a few
months already. I presented my _system for making timetables for small
aero-clubs_.

Over the summer, in my aeroclub, we noticed that it takes a lot of time and
effort to create chronometric tables (they are tables that a person is required
to fill in and they contain basic information about a flight). We also noticed
that it's quite difficult to manage available aircraft and resources. 

So,together with the director of my aeroclub, I started working on a webapp
which would lessen the difficulties that we were facing.

I never finished the webapp itself, but I did present a very _alpha_ version on
the _INOST_ fair of 2017, and I have received the silver award for my demo.

During the fair, I also presented my [pickup winder](/projects/pickup-winder)
for which I did not receive any awards.
