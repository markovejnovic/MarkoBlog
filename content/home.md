Hello! I'm Marko Vejnovic, an eighteen-year-old enrolled in [UWC Changshu
China](http://www.uwcchina.org/en). My interests are mostly in the field of
science and mathematics, but I am not shy to open up to other fields as well. I
plan on studying electrical engineering or computer science in college.
