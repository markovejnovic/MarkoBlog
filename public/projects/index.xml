      <description>Introduction Given my musical interests, I enjoy electrical guitars, and instruments in general. As I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a humbucker set-up guitar and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford one myself, I decided to make one myself. I thought it would be a great idea to actually learn some woodworking, since all of my woodworking experience prior to this was minor. Given that my father has already made two electrics guitar, I asked him to help me build it, but to teach me, rather than making it himself.</description>

      <description>Over the course of many years, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on quite a few projects. I&amp;rsquo;ve listed all of them here in chronological order.</description>

      <description>Introduction UWC Changshu China, the school I attend, has a single kitchen available to the students. This kitchen is shared between all of the students. The system for managing the usage of the kitchen (using paper forms) proved to be ineffective and overly complicated. I wished to improve on this design by implementing an online booking system. Currently, this software is hosted on ikcsc.site.
System The system is comprised of two elements1: a SQLite database and a Java2 application which handles database management and provides the frontend.</description>

      <description>Introduction I wished to write my own blog. To achieve this, I originally intended to use a custom markdown language for writing blog entries, which would support very niche requirements - dedicated citations, for example. Sadly, nothing ever came out of this as I did not really have a lot of time to dedicate to something of such high requirements. My blog (this one), ended up being written in Hugo, as that proved to be much faster.</description>

      <title>Tarpauline Kayak</title>

      <description>Introduction As part of the mechanical engineering 执行 1 in UWC Changshu China, we were making very low cost kayaks mostly out of PVC tubing. The original idea was for three teams to construct three different kayaks which would compete against each other.
Design I had the idea of using PVC tubes as a skeleton and a tarpauline sheet as cover for the skeleton. The skeleton consisted of 6 long tubes and 9 ribs which provided structural integrity:</description>

      <description>Introduction When I was working on building my Flying V, since I wanted to wind my own pickups, I realized I needed to make a machine that can wind them.
So, I had to make a pickup winder. And, well, I did!
Design So, basically, it was a simple motor controlled by an Arduino Uno and an H-bridge. I added an encoder so that I can count the number of revolutions made, since I wanted to keep that close for two bobbins of a humbucker.</description>

      <description>Introduction During the HHG-Gymnasium BL MINT 2017 student exchange, the need for an application to quickly generate text in the wavefront .obj format for 3D printing has arisen. I have noticed that using Blender for such a simple task seemed to be quite overkill, so I decided to write an application over a night.
How It Works The application is written in python so that it can interface with Blender&amp;rsquo;s python API.</description>

      <title>Wah Wah Pedal</title>

      <description>Introduction As an aspiring, albeit unsuccessful guitar player, I felt the need to have a wah pedal1. Of course, not having the resources to buy one forced me to build one. I wanted to achieve a Hendrix-like sound, so I decided to opt for a Vox V847A design.
Schematic The schematic is given.
The transistors I used were readily available 2N5457&amp;rsquo;s.
PCB Design Download The files (Eagle schematic and board layout) for the project are available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>Headphone Amplifier</title>

      <description>Introduction At the time, I used to have very high impedance headphones (if I remember - around 40Ω), so the audio output volume I was receiving from my computer was very low. I therefore wanted to make a small amplifier for those headphones. At first, I wanted to make a very simple LM386A-based amplifier, but I stumbled upon this small tube amplifier. I liked the idea of having a small tube amplifier, so I decided to make it.</description>

      <description>Introduction One of my first major electronics projects was definitely the Big Muff clone pedal that my father and I worked on. At the time, I already had an electric guitar, but was looking for a more filled and warmer sounding voice. Given that we couldn&amp;rsquo;t really afford a guitar pedal, my father decided to build me one. However, as he was very busy at the time, he couldn&amp;rsquo;t really finish it, to which I asked if I could finish it, to which he obliged!</description>
