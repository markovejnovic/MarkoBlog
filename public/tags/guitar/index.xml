      <description>Introduction A few mates of mine and I got back together in UWC. We decided to play for the first open mic1 of this year in UWC CSC. Given that three out of four band members enjoy metal, we decided to play metal for the open mic. This was a first for the school, since metal was never played on this campus. We decided for the first song to be a lighter one, so we decided on Maiden&amp;rsquo;s hit The Trooper.</description>

      <description>Introduction After finishing up my ACT test and figuring stuff out after coming back from UWC Changshu, I get a ring from an old mate of mine who asks me if our old band would like to go to the annual guitar festival in my hometown of Banja Luka.
Our old band consisted of three guys - David Crncevic, Aleksandar Curguz and myself. We used to play metal, but since both David and me were going to UWC&amp;rsquo;s we couldn&amp;rsquo;t continue playing together.</description>
