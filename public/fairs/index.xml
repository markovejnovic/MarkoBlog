      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been (and hopefully - will be) presenting projects at fairs. These are some of my experiences with fairs.</description>

      <description>On this year&amp;rsquo;s INOST fair, I decided to present what I was working on a few months already. I presented my system for making timetables for small aero-clubs.
Over the summer, in my aeroclub, we noticed that it takes a lot of time and effort to create chronometric tables (they are tables that a person is required to fill in and they contain basic information about a flight). We also noticed that it&amp;rsquo;s quite difficult to manage available aircraft and resources.</description>

      <title>Festival of Science 2016</title>

      <description>Similarly to the previous previous Festival of Science, I wanted to show science in a field that young children enjoy. So a friend of mine, David Crncevic, and myself decided to marry science and music.
Each of us made our own FuzzFace clones and we tried to show how exactly music is innately connected to science.
I&amp;rsquo;d say we succeeded - kids enjoyed our playing, as well as showed interest in science.</description>

      <description>After not receiving any awards at the INOST festival of the year, I was invited by The programming camp Pitam Da to present my oscilloscope on the annual Tesla Festival in Novi Sad. Reluctantly, I agreed.
Contrary to my prejudice, it&amp;rsquo;s been an excellent experience, from hanging around with friends to actually presenting our own projects, we all had a wonderful and fun experience.
I did win a shared1 first prize on the festival, among some of my friends.</description>

      <description>This year, I presented my Portable Android Oscilloscope which did not receive any awards. Overall, it was a fun experience to combine both software and hardware development.</description>

      <description>The Festival of Science is a fair which tries to promote science with younger people. I decided to try promoting mathematics with middle-school students by introducing mathematics in the popular field of computers.
I decided that showing them basic TTL circuits, and how from these we can make basic calculators.
I then showed them how boolean logic describes these TTL circuits beautifully.
I&amp;rsquo;d say that the middle school students enjoyed this, because they like computers so I think it was good that I introduced mathematics (which is generally not popular) into a very popular field.</description>

      <description>Like the INOST fair the year before, I decided I would like to showcase my innovative products. This year&amp;rsquo;s INOST fair, I decided to showcase my Big Muff pedal, my Headphone amplifier and my Automated Camera Slider.
For the Automated Camera Slider, I was awarded the silver medal, and for the Big Muff, I was awarded the honorary award.</description>

      <description>INOST is an exhibition of ideas, innovations and creations, where people from multiple countries gather to showcase their innovative or creative products.
Being a curious kid, my middle school physics teacher told me of this fair and how I could go. I did want to build something, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what exactly I wanted to make.
I came back home, talked to my dad and he told me that we would think about it.</description>
