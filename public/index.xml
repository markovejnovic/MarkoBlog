      <description>Introduction So, about three days ago, I managed to get my hands on a cheapish second hand Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have a phone for almost a year, and living without a phone in China to be very difficult. I decided to buy a cheap phone on Xianyu.
Buying the phone After looking around a bit, I concluded that the Xiaomi Redmi 4X seemed to be a good phone for my requirements.</description>

      <description>Introduction A few mates of mine and I got back together in UWC. We decided to play for the first open mic1 of this year in UWC CSC. Given that three out of four band members enjoy metal, we decided to play metal for the open mic. This was a first for the school, since metal was never played on this campus. We decided for the first song to be a lighter one, so we decided on Maiden&amp;rsquo;s hit The Trooper.</description>

      <description>Introduction After finishing up my ACT test and figuring stuff out after coming back from UWC Changshu, I get a ring from an old mate of mine who asks me if our old band would like to go to the annual guitar festival in my hometown of Banja Luka.
Our old band consisted of three guys - David Crncevic, Aleksandar Curguz and myself. We used to play metal, but since both David and me were going to UWC&amp;rsquo;s we couldn&amp;rsquo;t continue playing together.</description>

      <description>Introduction Given my musical interests, I enjoy electrical guitars, and instruments in general. As I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a humbucker set-up guitar and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford one myself, I decided to make one myself. I thought it would be a great idea to actually learn some woodworking, since all of my woodworking experience prior to this was minor. Given that my father has already made two electrics guitar, I asked him to help me build it, but to teach me, rather than making it himself.</description>

      <description>Finally, after a prolonged period, I am publishing this website! Some of my projects are up, others are not, but, as time goes on I plan on adding more and more stuff here.
Sadly, I am quite busy to commit fully to this website, but when I have time, I will set it up!</description>

      <description>Introduction UWC Changshu China, the school I attend, has a single kitchen available to the students. This kitchen is shared between all of the students. The system for managing the usage of the kitchen (using paper forms) proved to be ineffective and overly complicated. I wished to improve on this design by implementing an online booking system. Currently, this software is hosted on ikcsc.tk.
System The system is comprised of two elements1: a SQLite database and a Java2 application which handles database management and provides the frontend.</description>

      <description>Introduction I wished to write my own blog. To achieve this, I originally intended to use a custom markdown language for writing blog entries, which would support very niche requirements - dedicated citations, for example. Sadly, nothing ever came out of this as I did not really have a lot of time to dedicate to something of such high requirements. My blog (this one), ended up being written in Hugo, as that proved to be much faster.</description>

      <description>Introduction As part of the mechanical engineering 执行 1 in UWC Changshu China, we were making very low cost kayaks mostly out of PVC tubing. The original idea was for three teams to construct three different kayaks which would compete against each other.
Design I had the idea of using PVC tubes as a skeleton and a tarpauline sheet as cover for the skeleton. The skeleton consisted of 6 long tubes and 9 ribs which provided structural integrity:</description>

      <description>Introduction During the HHG-Gymnasium BL MINT 2017 student exchange, the need for an application to quickly generate text in the wavefront .obj format for 3D printing has arisen. I have noticed that using Blender for such a simple task seemed to be quite overkill, so I decided to write an application over a night.
How It Works The application is written in python so that it can interface with Blender&amp;rsquo;s python API.</description>

      <description>Introduction As an aspiring, albeit unsuccessful guitar player, I felt the need to have a wah pedal1. Of course, not having the resources to buy one forced me to build one. I wanted to achieve a Hendrix-like sound, so I decided to opt for a Vox V847A design.
Schematic The schematic is given.
The transistors I used were readily available 2N5457&amp;rsquo;s.
PCB Design Download The files (Eagle schematic and board layout) for the project are available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>Headphone Amplifier</title>

      <description>Introduction At the time, I used to have very high impedance headphones (if I remember - around 40Ω), so the audio output volume I was receiving from my computer was very low. I therefore wanted to make a small amplifier for those headphones. At first, I wanted to make a very simple LM386A-based amplifier, but I stumbled upon this small tube amplifier. I liked the idea of having a small tube amplifier, so I decided to make it.</description>

      <description>Introduction One of my first major electronics projects was definitely the Big Muff clone pedal that my father and I worked on. At the time, I already had an electric guitar, but was looking for a more filled and warmer sounding voice. Given that we couldn&amp;rsquo;t really afford a guitar pedal, my father decided to build me one. However, as he was very busy at the time, he couldn&amp;rsquo;t really finish it, to which I asked if I could finish it, to which he obliged!</description>

      <description>Introduction Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m Marko Vejnovic, an eighteen-year-old enrolled in UWC Changshu China. My interests are mostly in the field of science and mathematics, but I am not shy to open up to other fields as well. I plan on studying digital electrical engineering or computer science in college.</description>
