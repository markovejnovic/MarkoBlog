      <description>In 2014, an Italian fencer by the name of Giacomo Fanizza came to my hometown to try and spread the fencing culture to a country which did not have it. He almost single-handedly managed to raise some interest and created a fencing club.
A dozen or so of us joined the club in the beginning, but as years went on, people started leaving. Sadly, Giacomo was forced to go back to Italy due to financial reasons.</description>

      <description>In 2006, I was inspired by the likes of actors like Jackie Chan to pick up a martial art. My father saw a poster for a Karate club inviting new members, so I signed up.
At such a young age, I found Karate to be a very good practice for my body as well as a way of venting a lot of the issues I had inside and outside of school.</description>
